![Air temperature, precipitation (Jun-Aug), Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), water temperature, and salinity trends from 1998 to 2022. The color shades for water temperature and salinity indicate sampling location and values shown are the averages (95% confidence interval) across all Environmental Protection Commission (EPC) stations in each bay segment and sampling months for each year.

Points show the average (95% confidence interval) across all stations in each bay segment and sampling months for each year.

![Trends from 1998 to 2022 for temperature and salinity measurements at long-term monitoring stations in Tampa Bay. Results for seasonal Kendall tests by station and monitoring location (top or bottom of the water column) are shown in (a) with color and shape corresponding to the estimated annual slope as change per year (yr$^{-1}$). Summarized seasonal trends by month are shown as (b) the average magnitude of change (slope) per month for all stations in each bay segment for temperature and salinity. Bay segment outlines are shown in (a); OTB: Old Tampa Bay, HB: Hillsborough Bay, MTB: Middle Tampa Bay, LTB: Lower Tampa Bay.](figs/suppkendall.png){#fig-suppkendall}

![Examples of Generalized Additive Models of bottom water temperature and salinity for station 66 in Old Tampa Bay.  Models were fit using a continuous smoothing spline for decimal year.  Monthly observations are shown as points and daily predictions from the models as lines.](figs/suppgamex.png){#fig-supgamex}

![Example of mixed effects models for the estimated number of days per year that temperature (red) or salinity (blue) were above or below thresholds of 30 $^\circ$C or 25 psu, respectively, from 1988 to 2022. The bottom row (black) shows the number of days when both temperature was above and salinity was below the thresholds. The models included station as a random effect for each bay segment, with grey lines indicating individual station trends, grey points as actual number of days, and thicker lines indicating the overall model fit. Slopes are shown in the bottom left of each facet. OTB: Old Tampa Bay, HB: Hillsborough Bay, MTB: Middle Tampa Bay, LTB: Lower Tampa Bay.](figs/suppmixeff.png){#fig-suppmixeff}

![Partial effects of smoothers (rows) by bay segment (columns) from a Generalized Additive model used to describe seagrass change relative to year, light attenuation, and the number of days each year when both temperature was above 30 $^\circ$C and salinity was below 25 ppt. The EPC data were used to develop the model. Partial effects describe the modeled association between each predictor and seagrass frequency occurrence after accounting for the effects of the other predictors. The model also included smoothed interaction terms with year (not shown). See Table S8 for additional model fit statistics.
