![Air temperature, precipitation, hydrologic load, Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), water temperature, and salinity trends from 1998 to 2022. Points for water temperature and salinity are colored by sampling location in the water column and show the average (95% confidence interval) across all stations in each bay segment and sampling months for each year. OTB: Old Tampa Bay, HB: Hillsborough Bay, MTB: Middle Tampa Bay, LTB: Lower Tampa Bay.](figs/suppmeteowqraw.png){#fig-suppmeteowqraw}

![Bottom water temperature and salinity trends from 1996 to 2021 for stations from the Fisheries Independent Monitoring program. Points show the average (95% confidence interval) across all stations in each bay segment and sampling months for each year.

![Bottom water temperature and salinity trends from 2004 to 2022 for stations from the Pinellas County Department of Environmental Management in Old Tampa Bay. Points show the average (95% confidence interval) across all stations in each bay segment and sampling months for each year.](figs/supppincotrnds.png){#fig-supppincotrnds}

![Trends from 1998 to 2022 for temperature and salinity measurements at long-term monitoring stations in Tampa Bay. Results for seasonal Kendall tests by station and monitoring location (top or bottom of the water column) are shown in (a) with color and shape corresponding to the estimated annual slope as change per year (yr$^{-1}$). Summarized seasonal trends by month are shown for (b) top and (c) bottom measurements as the percent of stations in each bay segment with significant increasing (temperature) or decreasing (salinity) trends. Bay segment outlines are shown in (a); OTB: Old Tampa Bay, HB: Hillsborough Bay, MTB: Middle Tampa Bay, LTB: Lower Tampa Bay.](figs/suppkendall.png){#fig-suppkendall}

<!-- ![Relationship between water temperature and discharge in the Hillsborough River (USGS gage 02303000) over time. The relationship is shown for February (dry month) and August (wet month) grouped by historic (1975-1999) and contemporary (2000-2022) time periods. Regression lines with 95% confidence intervals for each temporal grouping are shown.](figs/suppflowtemp.png){#fig-suppflowtemp} -->

![Examples of Generalized Additive Models of bottom water temperature and salinity for station 66 in Old Tampa Bay.  Models were fit using a continuous smoothing spline for decimal year.  Monthly observations are shown as points and daily predictions from the models as lines.](figs/suppgamex.png){#fig-supgamex}

![Example of mixed effects models for the estimated number of days per year that temperature (red) or salinity (blue) were above or below thresholds of 30 $^\circ$C or 25 psu, respectively, from 1988 to 2022. The bottom row (black) shows the number of days when both temperature was above and salinity was below the thresholds. The models included station as a random effect for each bay segment, with grey lines indicating individual station trends, grey points as actual number of days, and thicker lines indicating the overall model fit. Slopes for significant models are shown in the bottom right of each facet.
