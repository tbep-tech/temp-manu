## Abstract {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

Background: SST trends in Tampa Bay w/ EPC data, WFS, and deep GOM [@nickerson2023] showed that 1975 to 2022 trend for EPC was notable, but less so from 1998 to 2022. Also noted the trend was most pronounced in the winter, see Fig 3.

Heat stress combined with highlight accelerates decline of *E. acoroides*, used 36C [@zhang2023]

Widgeongrass colonization in Chesapeake Bay as an opportunistic, heat-tolerant species that has replaced Eelgrass, although former is sensitive to nutrient pulses. Paper provides an example of implications on climate change and nutrient management on foundation species and system resiliency [@hensel2023].

Focus on two time periods: full record and recent decline

Focus on two physical parameters: temperature and salinity

Temp background for TB: NOAA coastwatch trends

## Methods

Seagrass changes over time in @fig-seagrasschg.

Observed trends aggregated by year and bay segment across stations and months in @fig-meteowqraw.

The conceptual stressor diagram @fig-concept.

Salinity tolerance: Ruppia \> Halodule\> Thalassia \> Syringodium

Halodule:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985)

-   Salinity: grows well in most salinity ranges [@lirman2003], like Syringodium but more tolerant [@lewis1985], 10-35 (range) or \< 10 (S. Scolaro)

Thalassia:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985, @zieman1975), 30-31 (upper, from SS)

-   Salinity: 25 (lower, @lewis1985); 30, lowest at 5 (lower, @lirman2003), 33-38 (range, @phillips1960); 24-35 (range, @zieman1975 citing @phillips1960); 15 (SS)

Syringodium:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985), 29 (upper from SS)

-   Salinity: 20 (lower, @lewis1985), 25 (lower, @lirman2003); 20

@lewis1985 review of seagrass in Tampa Bay. @lirman2003 conducted exposure experiments to evaluate seagrass growth in response to a range of salinity conditions. @mcmillan1967 discusses growth of halodule, syringodium, thalassia, and ruppia in response to salinity increases (up to 75 psu), no info on lower limit. Cites @phillips1960 for a salinity range of Thalassia in Florida of 33 - 38 psu. @zieman1975 discusses seasonal variation of thalassia relative to temp and salinity

### Models

All models excluded Lower Tampa Bay because of minimal seagrass change over time. Evaluated total fo, percent change between years, and

GLMs of percent change each year by Sal, Temp, with year and bay segment interactions. Attempted different windows of time from approximate seagrass sample date, 30 days to one year. The best model was one that included an effect of Salinity and an interaction with bay segment. Hillsborough Bay showed a strong response of increasing likelihood of seagrass loss with number of days when salinity was below the threshold.

Then GAMs were evaluated looking at total by Salinity, with interaction of year and bay segment. Also created a model looking at percent change vs Temp and year/bay segment interaction.

Show plots of both the glm and gams.

## Results

For @fig-meteowqraw, salinity shows much higher inter-annual variability, but lower intra-year variation among stations. Trends are similar for bottom vs top, temperature shows stronger trend than salinity.

Kendall test results are shown in @fig-kendall.

An example of mixed effects models for two selected thresholds is shown in @fig-mixeff.

$$
Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{ij} + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

NMS results in @fig-nms and seagrass decline results in @fig-sgmod

## Discussion

Other areas showing seagrass loss - Florida Bay is different, less water flowing out of everglades and compounding SLR has elevated salinity and likely stress in other direction. Also, Biscayne Bay and IRL is a lot like OTB, poor flushing for example.

Viral/disease effects on seagrass change, [@vanbogaert2018] for TB and [@duffin2021] for Florida Bay.

OTB seagrass loss and role of pyrodinium, optimal temperatures from 28-31 [@lopez2021]. For salinity, highest growth rates at 24 psu and above, with decline in growth rates at 20 psu [@usup1994], in Florida growth has occurred in psu 10-45, bloom concentrations observed above 15 psu [@phlips2006; @lopez2021]. Optimal salinity range between 20-32 psu [@lopez2021].
