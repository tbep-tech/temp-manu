## Abstract {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

-   Importance of seagrass as foundation species
-   Tampa Bay context
-   Climate change stressors
-   Goals/objectives
    -   Describe

Background: SST trends in Tampa Bay w/ EPC data, WFS, and deep GOM [@nickerson2023] showed that 1975 to 2022 trend for EPC was notable, but less so from 1998 to 2022. Also noted the trend was most pronounced in the winter, see Fig 3.

Heat stress combined with highlight accelerates decline of *E. acoroides*, used 36C [@zhang2023]

Widgeongrass colonization in Chesapeake Bay as an opportunistic, heat-tolerant species that has replaced Eelgrass, although former is sensitive to nutrient pulses. Paper provides an example of implications on climate change and nutrient management on foundation species and system resiliency [@hensel2023].

Focus on two time periods: full record and recent decline

Focus on two physical parameters: temperature and salinity

## Methods

### Study area

Tampa Bay is the largest open-water estuary in Florida covering 400 mi$^2$ (1,036 km$^2$) and one of the largest in the Gulf of Mexico. The watershed covers an 2,200 mi$^2$ (5,872 km$^2$) with the Hillsborough, Alafia, Manatee, and Little Manatee Rivers contributing a majority of freshwater inflow to the bay. Tampa Bay straddles the temperate and tropical boundary of central Florida characterized by warm, humid conditions and a distinct rainy season during the summer months. The watershed is heavily developed and includes over 3 million people with 42% of the land as urban or suburban contributing substantial inputs of wastewater and stormwater runoff that can stress bay resources [@beck2023]. The geology of the watershed is rich in phosphates and mining activities have greatly altered the landscape, with notable spills and releases of wastewater that have affected water quality and biological resources [@garrett2011; @beck2022]. Important subtidal habitats include seagrasses, hard bottom, tidal flats, and oyster reefs, where a majority of management effort has focused on restoring and maintaining seagrass cover [@sherwood2017]. Additional native habitats include intertidal wetlands (mangroves, salt marshes, salt barriers) and pine forests, oak hammocks, and freshwater wetlands present in upland habitats [@Robison20]. Losses of native uplands and potentially restorable habitats to development in the watershed from 1990 to 2020 have been estimated at 295 mi$^2$ [763 km$^2$, @beck2023].

The Bay is divided into distinct sub-segments defined by physical and natural boundaries to assist with water quality management activities [@lewis1985]: Old Tampa Bay (OTB) in the northwest; Hillsborough Bay (HB) in the northeast; Middle Tampa Bay (MTB); and Lower Tampa Bay (LTB) that connects to the Gulf of Mexico. Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay have historically had the most degraded water quality conditions primarily from nutrient inputs from wastewater and stormwater [@greening2014]. Hydrologic conditions vary between the two, such that Hillsborough Bay receives a majority of direct surface water inflow from the Hillsborough and Alafia Rivers, whereas Old Tampa Bay receives much less inflow with a majority from multiple small tributaries [@tbep0623]. Notably, Old Tampa Bay has restricted circulation from multiple land bridges that traverse the bay [@sherwood2015; @luther2022]. Recurring seasonal harmful algal blooms of the dinoflagellete *Pyrodinium bahamense* have contributed to exceedances of the chlorophyll-a regulatory standard in Old Tampa Bay [@lopez2023]. By comparison, water quality conditions in Middle Tampa Bay and Lower Tampa Bay are generally better than the upper two bay segments primarily from more frequent water exchanges with the Gulf of Mexico and lower nutrient loading [@tbep0623]. All bay segments are relatively shallow, with a baywide mean depth of approximately 3 m. Light penetration typically reaches bottom habitats under current conditions, although seagrasses were historically limited by high phytoplankton production that affected light environments prior to wastewater regulation, particularly in Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay [@greening2014; @johansson15].

### Seagrass monitoring and change

The long-term recovery of seagrass habitats in Tampa Bay is a nationally-recognized success story that demonstrates a successful management paradigm. From 1988 to 2016, seagrasses increased 79% (18,376) to a total of acres ()

Salinity tolerance: Ruppia \> Halodule\> Thalassia \> Syringodium

Halodule:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985)

-   Salinity: grows well in most salinity ranges [@lirman2003], like Syringodium but more tolerant [@lewis1985], 10-35 (range) or \< 10 (S. Scolaro)

Thalassia:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985, @zieman1975), 30-31 (upper, from SS)

-   Salinity: 25 (lower, @lewis1985); 30, lowest at 5 (lower, @lirman2003), 33-38 (range, @phillips1960); 24-35 (range, @zieman1975 citing @phillips1960); 15 (SS)

Syringodium:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985), 29 (upper from SS)

-   Salinity: 20 (lower, @lewis1985), 25 (lower, @lirman2003); 20

@lewis1985 review of seagrass in Tampa Bay. @lirman2003 conducted exposure experiments to evaluate seagrass growth in response to a range of salinity conditions. @mcmillan1967 discusses growth of halodule, syringodium, thalassia, and ruppia in response to salinity increases (up to 75 psu), no info on lower limit. Cites @phillips1960 for a salinity range of Thalassia in Florida of 33 - 38 psu. @zieman1975 discusses seasonal variation of thalassia relative to temp and salinity

All models excluded Lower Tampa Bay because of minimal seagrass change over time. Evaluated total fo, percent change between years, and

GLMs of percent change each year by Sal, Temp, with year and bay segment interactions. Attempted different windows of time from approximate seagrass sample date, 30 days to one year. The best model was one that included an effect of Salinity and an interaction with bay segment. Hillsborough Bay showed a strong response of increasing likelihood of seagrass loss with number of days when salinity was below the threshold.

Then GAMs were evaluated looking at total by Salinity, with interaction of year and bay segment. Also created a model looking at percent change vs Temp and year/bay segment interaction.

Show plots of both the glm and gams.

## Results

For @fig-meteowqraw, salinity shows much higher inter-annual variability, but lower intra-year variation among stations. Trends are similar for bottom vs top, temperature shows stronger trend than salinity.

Kendall test results are shown in @fig-kendall.

An example of mixed effects models for two selected thresholds is shown in @fig-mixeff.

$$
Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{ij} + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

NMS results in @fig-nms and seagrass decline results in @fig-sgmod

## Discussion

Other areas showing seagrass loss - Florida Bay is different, less water flowing out of everglades and compounding SLR has elevated salinity and likely stress in other direction. Also, Biscayne Bay and IRL is a lot like OTB, poor flushing for example.

Viral/disease effects on seagrass change, [@vanbogaert2018] for TB and [@duffin2021] for Florida Bay.

Alternative nutrient pathways and role of macroalgae, competition for resources, shading, etc.

OTB seagrass loss and role of pyrodinium, optimal temperatures from 28-31 [@lopez2021]. For salinity, highest growth rates at 24 psu and above, with decline in growth rates at 20 psu [@usup1994], in Florida growth has occurred in psu 10-45, bloom concentrations observed above 15 psu [@phlips2006; @lopez2021]. Optimal salinity range between 20-32 psu [@lopez2021].
