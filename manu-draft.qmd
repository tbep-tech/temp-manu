## Abstract {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

Focus on two time periods: full record and recent decline

Focus on two physical parameters: temperature and salinity

Temp background for TB: NOAA coastwatch trends

## Methods

Seagrass changes over time in @fig-seagrasschg.

Observed trends aggregated by year and bay segment across stations and months in @fig-saltempraw.

The conceptual stressor diagram @fig-concept.

Salinity tolerance: Ruppia \> Halodule\> Thalassia \> Syringodium

Halodule:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985)

-   Salinity: grows well in most salinity ranges [@lirman2003], like Syringodium but more tolerant [@lewis1985], 10-35 (range) or \< 10 (S. Scolaro)

Thalassia:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985, @zieman1975), 30-31 (upper, from SS)

-   Salinity: 25 (lower, @lewis1985); 30, lowest at 5 (lower, @lirman2003), 33-38 (range, @phillips1960); 24-35 (range, @zieman1975 citing @phillips1960); 15 (SS)

Syringodium:

-   Temp: 20-30 (range, @lewis1985), 29 (upper from SS)

-   Salinity: 20 (lower, @lewis1985), 25 (lower, @lirman2003); 20

@lewis1985 review of seagrass in Tampa Bay. @lirman2003 conducted exposure experiments to evaluate seagrass growth in response to a range of salinity conditions. @mcmillan1967 discusses growth of halodule, syringodium, thalassia, and ruppia in response to salinity increases (up to 75 psu), no info on lower limit. Cites @phillips1960 for a salinity range of Thalassia in Florida of 33 - 38 psu. @zieman1975 discusses seasonal variation of thalassia relative to temp and salinity

## Results

For @fig-saltempraw, salinity shows much higher inter-annual variability, but lower intra-year variation among stations. Trends are similar for bottom vs top, temperature shows stronger trend than salinity.

Kendall test results are shown in @fig-kendall. 

## Discussion

Other areas showing seagrass loss - Florida Bay is different, less water flowing out of everglad and compounding SLR has elevated salinity and likely stress in other direction. Also, Biscayne Bay and IRL is a lot like OTB, poor flushing for example.

![Seagrass changes over time in Tampa Bay for (a) areal coverage and (b) frequency occurrence of major species. Changes are shown for major bay segments. Note the different time scale between (a) and (b). Coverage maps in (a) began in 1988 and seagrass transect monitoring in (b) began in 1998. Red lines in (a) show approximate capacity of seagrass coverage based on the baywide target of 40,000 acres.

Results for (a) seasonal Kendall tests by station and monitoring location (top or bottom of the waer column) are shown in (a) with color and shape corresponding to the estimated annual slope as change per year (yr-1).  Summarized seasonal trends by month are shown for (b) top and (c) bottom measurements as the percent of stations in each bay segment with significant decreasing (salinity) or increasing (temperature) trends.

## Tables {.unnumbered}

Summary of mixed-effects models evaluating increases in the number of days each year from 1974 to 2022 when salinity or temperature was below or above critical thresholds, respectively.  The slope estimates in the "Both" column indicate trends in the number of days when both salinity and temperature were below or above critical thresholds. ** p < 0.005, * p < 0.05, - no model. OTB (northwest): Old Tampa Bay, HB (northeast): Hillsborough Bay, MTB: Middle Tampa Bay, LTB: Lower Tampa Bay.

Number of days at the beginning and end of the period of record when salinity or temperature was below or above critical thresholds, respectively.  Values are the estimated mean number of days (plus standard error) from 1974 to 2022.  Columns for "Both" indicate the estimated number of days when both salinity and temperature were below or above critical thresholds.  Note that not all models are significant (see (table 1)). ** p < 0.005, * p < 0.05, - no model.
